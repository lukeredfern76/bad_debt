-- The first section of code calculates any negative rebilling. It creates a view of all Orion statements then identifies the most recent statement and the statement just before 12 months ago. Next, it joins these to the debtor listing from 12 months ago. Next, it identifies all consumption transactions and joins these where the effectiveAt date is older than the statements from 12 months ago but the transaction timestamp is after the invoice date from 12 months ago. Where the sum of these is negative then we count this as negative rebilling.
